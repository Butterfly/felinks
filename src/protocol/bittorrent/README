A short TODO list for the BT implementation:

	Torrents should be added to the global history.

	Peer IDs should be restorable from ~/.elinks/downloadhist.

	It needs to give up on unreachable peers.

	It should be possible to specify the download location.

	When the file is removed from under it (in the shell), either give
	a warning and stop downloading, or start over.

	Addition of a blacklist, either temporary (session) or persistant.
