Locale/PO.pm was imported from the Locale-PO-0.16 module available
from CPAN.  It will be modified to better suit the Perl scripts in
this directory, and the changes will be sent back to ALANSZ.  The
build system, documentation, and test cases of Locale-PO were not
imported, because it isn't obvious where they should be placed.
