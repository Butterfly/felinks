			Overview of the ELinks documentation

There is only limited documentation available for ELinks so far, sorry. It
basically consists of the documents in this directory and the features.conf,
README and INSTALL files in the project's root directory.

The files you will find in this directory are manpages living in the man/
directory and a bunch of .html and especially .txt (wait, you expect HTML
browser to carry its documentation around in HTML?) documents. The index.txt
file contains the table of contents which should help you navigating between
the files.

Tools
-----

The manual is written in asciidoc, however you will also need xmlto to process
docbook XML generated by asciidoc into manpages and the html-chunked manual.
If you want to translate .pod files you need pod2html.

All these tools are checked by configure, thus to successfully build all the
possible documentation (with the tools available on the system), just run

	$ make all-docs

in the doc/ directory.

Contributing
------------

Contributions are very warmly welcomed, whether it is fixing typos or bad
grammar, rewritings or new material. Any information relevant to ELinks usage
can be included in the manual, including FAQ material, tips and cheats ;)

There is no strict codingstyle, but please don't limit your use of whitespaces
and take a look at the style used in the current documents to get ideas of what
is reasonable.

Contributions should be sent to Jonas Fonseca <fonseca@diku.dk> or to the
ELinks mailing list. If you are changing something in an existing document,
please read about how to make unified patches in the Patches section of the
doc/hacking.txt file.
