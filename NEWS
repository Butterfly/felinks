file for details.

ELinks 0.12.GIT now, to be released as 0.12.0:
----------------------------------------------

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This list now contains all the important changes from ELinks 0.11.0 to
ELinks 0.12.GIT (049cc9c6b37951a739dfd6b20ca92c170188824c).  The next
step will be to scan through Bugzilla and look for bug numbers that
were not mentioned in related commit messages.

The list no doubt includes several changes that are not really
important enough.  Please move them to the separate "should be removed
from NEWS" list below, or coalesce several changes into one entry (but
do list all bug numbers).  It might be a good idea to sort the entries
roughly in decreasing order of importance.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

* Notable new features
  - (unfinished enhancement 822) UTF-8 as terminal charset: not
    merely UTF-8 I/O of a unibyte codepage as in previous versions.
    Double-cell (aka fullwidth) and non-BMP characters work too, but
    combining characters and right-to-left text do not.  The only
    multibyte charset ELinks can decode is still UTF-8, so if the
    server outputs e.g. Shift-JIS, you'd better recode with a proxy.
  - (enhancement 844) SMB protocol using libsmbclient.  This replaces
    the smbclient-based code that was disabled in ELinks 0.11.2.
* Incompatibilities
  - ECMAScript support is now disabled by default.  It has known bugs
    (548, 755, 771) with which malicious web pages can crash or hang
    ELinks, and its security goals are undocumented.  If you must
    enable ECMAScript support, it would be prudent to restrict the
    ELinks process with a sandbox of some kind.
  - (bug 871) The numbering of terminal.*.colors no longer depends on
    config options.  This change makes elinks.conf portable between
    different configurations but unfortunately not between this and
    previous versions.
  - Changed Python goto_url_hook(current) to goto_url_hook(new).  The
    hook can call the new function elinks.current_url() if desired.
    The Python scripting back-end is much more featureful than in
    previous releases, but it is still considered experimental.
* Miscellaneous
  - (enhancement 752) Documentation updates
  - (enhancement 381) Reduce memory consumption of codepages and some
    other arrays.
  - (enhancement) Reject invalid UTF-8 input from documents and
    terminals.
* Changes in terminal support
  - (enhancement) Mouse wheel support on BSD via moused -z 4
  - (enhancement) Support for mouse wheel over GPM
  - (bugfix 724) Better parsing of escape sequences and control
    sequences from the terminal.
  - (bugfix) Decode UTF-8 only from bytes, not from codes of special
    keys.
  - (new feature) 24-bit truecolor mode
  - (enhancement) "Resize terminal" tries to use the window size
    increment.
  - (new feature) Support Ctrl+Alt+letter key combinations.
  - (bugfix) Subprocess forked for SIGTSTP calls _exit, not exit.
  - (enhancement) Turn terminal transparency off by default.
* Changes in cookies and bookmarks
  - (new feature) "Add server" button in the cookie manager.
  - (enhancement) Tell the user how to move bookmarks.
  - (enhancement 887) Save in cookie manager should save cookies even
    if unmodified.

    globhist

    dialogs.

  - (bugfix 107) Recognize "localhost" in file: URIs.
  - (bugfix 756) "assertion (cached)->object.refcount >= 0 failed"
    after HTTP proxy was changed
  - (bugfix) Encode and decode filenames in FSP URLs.
  - (enhancement) FSP progress indicator and password prompt.
  - (bugfix) Support much longer locale-specific timestamps when
    formatting a directory listing.  LC_TIME=fi_FI.UTF-8 now works.
* Changes in parsing and rendering of HTML (without DOM)
  - (bugfix) Use frame->name instead of target avoiding possible segfault.
  - (bugfix 284) Render closing parentheses for HTML elements SUB, SUP
    in the same line; don't let them fall to the next.
